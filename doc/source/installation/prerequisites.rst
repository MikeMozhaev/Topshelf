Prerequisites
=============

Topshelf is a .Net framework for C# and will need a .Net runtime to run on.

To work with Topshelf you will need to be running on a Windows operating
system. The developers of Topshelf regulary test on Windows 7 and
Windows Server 2008RC2. Though it should still work on Windows Server 2003, as
long as .Net 3.5 sp1 is installed.

.Net Framework
""""""""""""""

Currently Topshelf is tested on .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 and .NET 4.0.
